        <p>he experiences we go through are what shapes us. Your internship will not only encourage personal
            development, but also
            a greater understanding of self. To know yourself is to know your goals and how to best achieve them.
            Finding this level
            of clarity is difficult, but sometimes all it takes is trying someone new, out of your comfort zone.

        <p>An Internship Provides Real Life Experience and Exposure. Employers in today's labor market rely heavily on
            resumes that
            illustrate a relevant work history, whether that's from internships, volunteer work, or actual job
            experience. A
            practical work background carries a major significance when attempting to enter the job market. It's all
            about
            competition.

        <p>Networking is an exchange of information between people, with the ultimate goal of establishing acquaintances
            and
            relationships to advance your professional career. Sure, you can attend a networking event without doing an
            internship,
            but you would be limiting yourself. Partaking in an internship allows you to establish deeper relationships
            than you
            normally would talking to a stranger one-on-one.

        <p>The student is given a chance to decide whether they wish to continue with their current career path or try
            something
            else. The more experience you acquire, the better you position yourself for success in landing a job. An
            internship is
            the building blocks necessary for creating the path to a successful career. So next time you're on a gap
            year or summer
            break, you might want to consider indulging in a meaningful internship and build towards your future.
